        <h2>Homemade Brownies recipe</h2>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>

<ul>
            <li>1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter</li>
            <li>2 cups granulated sugar</li>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>Optional: 1 cup chopped nuts (such as walnuts or pecans)</li>
            <li>Optional: 1 cup chocolate chips</li>
</ul>
        <h4>Instructions:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking pan or line it with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over low heat. Remove from heat once melted.</li>
            <li>Stir in the sugar until well combined. Let the mixture cool slightly.</li>
            <li>Beat in the eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, sift together the flour, cocoa powder, salt, and baking powder.</li>
            <li>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
            <li>If desired, fold in the chopped nuts and chocolate chips until evenly distributed throughout the batter.</li>
            <li>Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan and spread it out evenly.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs. Be careful not to overbake, as you want the brownies to be fudgy.</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven and let the brownies cool in the pan on a wire rack before slicing and serving.</li>
        </ol>
